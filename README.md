PROJECT NAME

BY "The Lads"
MEMBERS: Finley Morris, Matt McConachie, Eoin Moffatt, Silvia d'Alessandro, Isabelle Griffiths 

OVERVIEW OF GAME
What is your game about? What are its key mechanics? What are its main narrative
ideas and themes?

INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS
(Each group member should write a short section outlining what they contributed
and their process. What did you do? Why did you do what you did?

Finley's updates;
28/2 ; created files for each tilemap and the player and reorganised code where necessary. Integrated player controller and tilemap; functional. This is the foundation for the project and should leave ideas for how to proceed. Using assets from class as placeholder to check code works. 


Matt's Update: 4/3/2024 
- change assets from placeholder
- recognition that the player has picked up the key
- the key needs to be able to disappear - figuring this out
- *potential* - figured out how to display and design multiple tilemaps - for demos purposes we will use use 1 tilemap
- mood board - gives a rough idea of what we are planning to do - Eoin has finished moodboard
- 

Izzy and Ivi:
- we created all assets to be used
e.g: shed, grass, grass with flowerss, key, character, trees, rocks.
- Placed each asset into the tile map and decided the layout of where they should go 
- with the graph there was white lines caused by the stroke (245) in the debug function, which we resolved. 
- stuggle of the tree asset filling the tile space, which we later resolved and redesigned and uploaded the new version onto the sketch.js.
